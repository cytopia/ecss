Describtion:
===========================
Extended CSS is a preprocessor for a normal css file that will add inheritance
as a language construct.

Currently supported inheritance:
+ single
+ multiple
+ recursive (1st level only)

Added keyword:
+ 'extends'


ECSS actually emerged as a side-product by sweany (php framework|https://github.com/lockdoc/sweany)
and comes under the same license.


Usage:
===========================
1.) Put ecss.php into the directory with all of your css files.
2.) Do not directly embed your css files into your html, but rather through this wrapper
3.) Include your CSS files as follows:
 /path/to/css/dir/ecss.php?file=YOUR_CSS_FILE_1.css
 /path/to/css/dir/ecss.php?file=YOUR_CSS_FILE_2.css

4.) If you have finished developing your css files, you can call each of your files with 'compressed'
to produce a stripped file
 /path/to/css/dir/ecss.php?file=YOUR_CSS_FILE_1.css&compressed
 /path/to/css/dir/ecss.php?file=YOUR_CSS_FILE_2.css&compressed

Now paste each of those outputs into normal css files
 
 
 
 
Processing Examples:
===========================

Your CSS File:
---------------
/** normal defines **/
#header {
	width:      50px;
	height:     90px;
	color:		blue;
}
.baseColor {
	color:      #FFFFFF;
	background: #CECECE;
}
/** inherit some stuff **/
.myBox extends #header, .baseColor {
	width:      60px;
}


Preprocessed File:
---------------
/** normal defines **/
#header {
	width:      50px;
	height:     90px;
}
.baseColor {
	color:      #FFFFFF;
	background: #CECECE;
}
/** inherit some stuff **/
.myBox extends #header, .baseColor {
	height:     90px;
	color:      #FFFFFF;
	background: #CECECE;
	width:      60px;
}

Notes on overwriting:

'color' was inheritated from #header and .baseColor,
but the last element (.baseColor) applied the final value.

'width' was inheritated from #header, but the local definition
is stronger than parent defines.
